## What you need to build JsSIP

You just need to have `Node.js`/`npm` and `git` installed.

* [Install Node.js via package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
* [Install Node.js from source](http://nodejs.org)
* [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

**NOTE:** `npm` comes with `node` now.


## How to build JsSIP

Clone a copy of the main JsSIP git repo by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP.git
```

Enter the directory and install the Node dependencies:
```
cd JsSIP && npm install
```

Make sure you have `grunt` installed by testing:
```
grunt -version
```

Finally, to get a complete version of JsSIP, type the following:
```
grunt
```

The built version of JsSIP will be available in the `dist/` subdirectory in both flavors: normal and minified. Both linted (with JSHint).

**NOTE:** The website and documentation of JsSIP will be ready very soon in [www.jssip.net](http://www.jssip.net).

What you need to build JsSIP
----------------------------

You just need to have `Node.js`/`npm` and `git` installed.

* [Install Node.js via package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
* [Install Node.js from source](http://nodejs.org)
* [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

**NOTE** npm comes with node now.

How to build JsSIP
------------------

Clone a copy of the main JsSIP git repo by running:

    git clone https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP.git

Enter the directory and install the Node dependencies:

    cd JsSIP && npm install


Make sure you have `grunt` installed by testing:

    grunt -version


Finally, to get a complete version of JsSIP, type the following:

    grunt && grunt post


The built version of JsSIP will be available in the `dist/` subdirectory in both flavors; normal and minified. Both linted (with JSHint).
